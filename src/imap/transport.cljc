(ns imap.transport
  "The wire boundary for IMAP4rev1 (RFC 3501): a 4-fn `Transport` protocol
  (write!/read-line!/read-n!/close!) that `imap.client` drives and every
  other namespace in this library is blind to. The real transport
  (`tls-connect`) is JVM-only (a raw `SSLSocket`, byte-counted so
  `read-n!` can satisfy IMAP literals exactly); tests inject a fake
  in-memory `Transport` instead, the same injection shape as
  `cloudflare.client`'s `:http-fn` / `gmail.client`'s `:http-fn`, adapted
  for a stateful line-oriented protocol instead of one-shot HTTP requests.

  ## Reads are binary strings, not UTF-8

  Everything read off the wire is decoded **ISO-8859-1**, one byte per
  character, so character *n* is byte *n*. That is deliberate and it is
  the contract `kotoba-lang/org-ietf-mime` states for its input.

  A message is bytes, and its parts routinely disagree about what those
  bytes mean — a UTF-8 body beside an ISO-2022-JP subject beside a PDF.
  Decoding the whole literal as UTF-8 destroys every part that was not
  UTF-8, and does it quietly: the result is U+FFFD, not an error. This
  transport did decode as UTF-8, and the symptom was a Japanese message
  body arriving as `e1n2WkdDf\\ufffdW~Y` — mojibake that looked like a
  parser bug three libraries away from the cause.

  Command *writes* stay UTF-8, because a command is text this library
  composed rather than bytes it received. The one place that matters is
  `client/append!`, whose literal length is therefore a UTF-8 byte count.")

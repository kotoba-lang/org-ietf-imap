(ns imap.protocol
  "Pure IMAP4rev1 (RFC 3501) command construction and response parsing --
  no I/O here. `imap.transport` is the wire, `imap.client` drives the
  request/response loop; this namespace only turns data into command
  strings and turns response lines back into data, so it's testable
  without a socket at all.

  ## What this parses, and what it deliberately does not

  Commands, tagged completions, untagged responses, response codes,
  flag lists, SEARCH results and literal markers -- the wire syntax of
  RFC 3501 §7 and §9.

  **It does not parse messages.** A fetched message comes back as the
  bytes the server sent, and `kotoba-lang/org-ietf-mime` turns those into
  headers, parts, attachments and decoded text. That library already
  existed when this one grew whole-message reads, and for one commit this
  namespace carried its own `split-message` / `decode-body` /
  quoted-printable decoder instead -- a worse copy of a tested thing,
  which got multipart wrong (returning the raw parts) where `mime.parse`
  gets it right (`multipart/alternative` orders worst-to-best, so the
  *last* match wins). Message format is that library's subject and the
  wire protocol is this one's."
